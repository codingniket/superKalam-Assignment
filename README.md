# SuperKalam Mobile Assignment

## 💡 Description

I want to become better at Chess(/Poker/Guitar). But do I really need to learn ALL techniques & become pro in it? Obviously, no.

So, I don't want to go on YT & spend endless time searching right videos. I might get information overloaded & leave the hobby entirely.A good playlist of just 5-8 techniques as per the level I want to achieve should be enough. And as I am mastering a technique, I can keep checking that technique off my list. Or strike out a particular one from my list if I realise I don't like it or find difficult.
